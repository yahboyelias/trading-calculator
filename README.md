# Futures Strategy & Simulation Calculator: User Guide

# What is This Program?
This tool is an all-in-one calculator designed to help you build, plan, and visualize a complete, data-driven trading strategy. It moves you from guessing to making decisions based on sound mathematical principles.

The calculator is broken down into three core sections that work together:

Strategy Analysis: Helps you understand the relationship between your win rate and the risk you need to take.

Trade Level Calculator: Gives you precise, volatility-based prices for your stop-loss and take-profit orders.

Monte Carlo Simulation: Simulates your strategy over hundreds of trades to show you the potential long-term outcomes and the inherent risks.

# How to Set Up Your Trade (Step-by-Step)
Follow these steps in order to build a complete trading plan.

Step 1: Analyze Your Strategy
Before you do anything else, you need to know if your strategy is mathematically viable.

Enter Your Win Chance (%): Based on your backtesting or experience, enter your estimated win rate.

Check the Break-Even R:R: The calculator will instantly show you the Reward:Risk ratio you need just to break even.

Set Your Target R:R: In the next section, make sure your "Target R:R" is higher than this break-even number. If your break-even is 1:2.33, a target of 1:3 is a good starting point.

Step 2: Calculate Your Trade Levels
This is where you get the exact prices for your orders.

Set Direction: Choose Long (if you're buying) or Short (if you're selling).

Enter Entry Price: The price at which you plan to execute your trade.

Enter ATR Value: Look at the ATR indicator on your trading chart for your chosen timeframe and enter that number here.

Set ATR Multiplier: This determines how far your stop-loss will be. A value of 2 is common, as it places your stop outside of the average market noise.

Set Target R:R: Input the Reward:Risk ratio you decided on in Step 1.

The calculator will now display your exact Stop-Loss Price, Take-Profit Price, and the dollar amount you are risking per unit of the asset.

Step 3: Simulate Your Future
This section shows you what could happen if you follow your plan consistently.

Enter Simulation Parameters: Fill in your Start Capital, the Risk per Trade (%) (1-2% is standard), and the Number of Trades you want to simulate.

Run Simulation: Click the button to run 1,000 simulations of your strategy.

# Analyze the Results:

The Chart: Shows 100 possible paths your account could take. Notice the wide range of outcomesâ€”this is the reality of trading.

The Summary: This gives you the key statistics: the median (most typical) result, the best and worst-case outcomes, and the overall probability that your strategy will be profitable over the long run.

# What is the Average True Range (ATR)?
The Average True Range (ATR) is one of the most important tools for managing risk.

In simple terms, ATR measures market volatility, or "noise." It tells you the average distance the price has moved over a specific number of recent candles.

Why Is It So Important?
The single biggest mistake new traders make is setting their stop-loss too close to their entry price. The market is chaotic, and small, random price swings can easily knock you out of a good trade before it has a chance to work.

The ATR helps you solve this problem. By placing your stop-loss at a multiple of the ATR (like 2x ATR), you are placing it outside of the normal market noise. This gives your trade the "breathing room" it needs to be successful while still protecting you from a major loss.

Think of it like setting your towel down at the beach. You don't put it right at the water's edge where the small waves will get it. You look at the average wave height and place your towel a safe distance away. The ATR is your tool for measuring those waves.

# How to Set Up the ATR Indicator on Your Chart
Adding the ATR indicator is simple on almost any charting platform (like TradingView, Thinkorswim, etc.).

Find the "Indicators" Menu: Look for a button or menu item on your chart, usually at the top, labeled "Indicators," "Studies," or sometimes just "fx."

Search for ATR: In the search bar that appears, type Average True Range. Click on it when it appears in the list. The ATR will appear as a new panel at the bottom of your price chart.

Check the Settings: You can usually hover over the indicator's name and click a "Settings" or gear icon.

Length: This is the most important setting. It determines how many recent candles the indicator looks at to calculate the average volatility. The default and industry standard is 14. It's highly recommended you stick with this number.

Read the Value: The current ATR value is the number shown on the far right of the indicator's line. This is the number you will enter into the calculator.
